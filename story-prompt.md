Write a story about a dog who's humans have left him at home for a vacation. He thinks they've accidentally abandoned him, so he breaks out of the house to try to rejoin them. After cleverly breaking out, he tries to find his humans, but gets distracted along the way, i.e. by squirrels, "free" dumpster food, etc. He goes on a long journey, asking neighbor dogs if they've seen the humans. Some are nice, others are scary. He meets a beautiful girl dog, only for her to get whisked inside by the owners. The pound is called, he is chased by the "police", and hides in an old barn to stay away. Eventually, he finds signs of the humans who left him, and resumes his journey, but he gets turned around and ends up going straight back home, only to find his humans were already back home, waiting for him, worried half to death.
